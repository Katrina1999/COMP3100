Introduction
Priority Scheduling is the task of scheduling jobs based on a scale of importance. 
This importance is based on the submission time in which a particular job is sent to the scheduler. 
Stage 2 of Group 8’s Priority Job Scheduler for Distributed Systems involves understanding and implementing three simple scheduling algorithms that are based on memory allocation policies.
The three scheduling algorithms implemented in Group 8’s priority scheduler are First-Fit, Best-Fit and Worst-Fit algorithms schemes. 
Stage 2 of this project also includes producing a simulation log generated by the server-side simulator and is based on simulation statistics that are presented to the team members at the end of simulation. 
Group 8’s algorithm design document features the design considerations and preliminaries for data structures used in Group 8’s Priority Scheduler as well as detailed algorithm descriptions for each of the three simple scheduling algorithms; First-Fit, Best-Fit and Worst-Fit Algorithms.
